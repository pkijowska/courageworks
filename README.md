## The problem:
- How often would you like to get a better view of the product you are buying? How can you make your website stand out from others? The VR helps to get an immersive opportunity to see things in a better way. In my opinion, in the future, we will be purchasing items using the VR glasses.

## The concept:
- ** Courageworks is the place for you if you are looking to buy a high-end art. It is the "welcome-to-the-future" type of place where you can see products in 360 perspective. **
