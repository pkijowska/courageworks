## The problem:

- How often would you like to get a better view of the product you are buying? How can you make your website stand out from others? The VR helps to get an immersive opportunity to see things in a better way. In my opinion, in the future, we will be purchasing items using the VR glasses.



## The concept:

- Courageworks is the place for you if you are looking to buy a high-end art. It is the "welcome-to-the-future" type of place where you can see products in 360 perspective. **

## Mostly proud of:

- My idea. I really wanted to do something different and take an ecommerce website to the next level.
- The CSS and design of the website. I think I did a pretty good job with it.



## Challenges:

- First time using VR
- Not enough time to add the backend  
- Limited resources when it comes to React 360
- Limited in terms of getting a proper 360 picture for the art gallery



## The todos:

- Add backend for the full functionality
- Brush up the VR thing. Add more VR features?

## Thank you:
- Rashida for telling me to stick to the VR idea
- All my lovely classmates from SEI33. You guys challenged me so much and I have learnt so much because of you.
- Joel for continous support
- My boyfriend (who is not a programmer) to pat me on back and tell me I am doing great (I did really needed it!)  

## How to install:

- ** npm install, npm run start **
